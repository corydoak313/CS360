CS360: Mobile Architect and Programming

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
- The app I developed was an Inventory App. The app allowed the user, being a working of the company it was intended for, to be able to manage their inventory by adding, deleting, or modifying data within the database. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
- The screens necessary for the users were a login screen or new user creation if necessary when they first open the app. From here it will show them the database where they can manage their inventory. There is also a menu that shows the Help screen and here they can opt-in for SMS messages about the app. The design of the app was kept straightforward for the users to navigate. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
- To begin, I utilized the XML file of Android Studio to help get the visual of the application. This allowed me to have an  idea of how I wanted the navigation of the screens to go and how each screen would work. Since I am a visual learner, this seemed to help aid in the designing process and I would continue to work this way if applicable!

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
- As I was writing out the code, I continuously ran the project to make sure any adjustments I was making were working correctly. If I found that it was not, then I would double check for any issues, revert to what I had and try again. I found that most of the time it was a simple typo in the syntax. Usually, the error would prompt for a fix before I ran the code.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
- I think at first, I just didn't know where to start. Looking at the overall project, it seemed overwhelming at first. Once I started then it was not as overwhelming to chip away at the iceberg. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
- I thoroughly enjoyed playing with the XML file of the code. I found that the design process was more intriguing than creating the functionality of the code. It was also satisfying to make sure everything was aesthetically appealing and symetrical.
